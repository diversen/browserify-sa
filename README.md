# browserify-sa

## Install 

Install global: 

    sudo npm install browserify-sa -g
    
You will need browserify and uglify-js in recent versions as global installs: 

    sudo  npm install -g uglify-js browserify

## Usage

Single command, no options.

    browserify-sa 

Run this command in a npm package and make a standalone build of the package. 

Basicly a simple wrapper around browserify that does something like this: 

    mkdir -p dist && browserify moduleMain -s moduleName > dist/moduleName.js

This makes a dist/moduleName.js file based on 'main' and 'name' in package.json

The build also includes common package.json fields like author and license.
